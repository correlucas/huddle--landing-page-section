## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Responsive Design
- CSS Animations
- Media queries

### What I learned

I learned how to use SVG/Paths in html/css. Using this knowldge I recreated the website logo as a SVG in Illustrator(the logo was a png image) and make a single path element making possible to hover it and apply effects like transitions and fill. I've learned also how can I disable hover effect in touch/mobile devices using the media query property @media (hover: hover) {}. I also applied a animation on logo, where the icon flip and rotate while logo wordmark is hovered.
